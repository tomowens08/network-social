<p>If you want to add your own applications which can be branded give you more fame than just follow our very simple proceedure....</p>
<p>We publish most of how our website works, unlike other websites. This make it easier for you to integrate your own stuff.</p>
<p>Users can then include that app on their profile should they wish.</p>
<p>You can source the information form URL's that you own or have access to or we can provide the hosting in some cases. We will explain to you the architecture of the website as well as available variables to mess around with and create your own dynamic controls.</p>
<p>Fist of their are for clearity the style codes:</p>
<p>Adding HTML or CSS to your profile through code is very simple, but it would be easier to know what class apply to what.</p>
<p class="style1">NO JARGON BIT:</p>
<p>&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;!--<br />
  .style1 {<br />
font-family: Tahoma;<br />
font-size: 18px;<br />
}<br />
--&gt;<br />
&lt;/style&gt;  </p>
<p>&lt;p class=&quot;style1&quot;&gt;NO JARGON BIT:&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>Style code looks like this above, class governs the look of the text above using the rules in between the &lt;style&gt; &lt;/style&gt; parts. </p>
<p>With HTML for intsnce the ccode backdrop=&quot;nameofgif.gif &quot; alters the background.</p>
<p>This site uses the &quot;nav&quot; class to apply to text in the nav menu..... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you upload apps, they will be placed inside the uploadphp folder: http://www.thissite.com/uploadphp , so to affect other objects on this sever you will need to know where the user images are. they are fond in the thiswebsite.com/images_gd/cache each image is named by number which correspomds to the user name ID of the member who uploaded it.</p>
<p>Are you with me so far?</p>
<p>Good. You can also use availe browser variables such as memberID is the member you are browsing, loginID is you. You can connect to the database to gather more data using php code: include &quot;../includes/conn.php&quot;</p>
<p>Once you do this you can use codes such as peopleclass.php which will include codes that summons the set of fatured members using $image and $name </p>
