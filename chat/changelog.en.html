<h2>ChangeLog</h2>

<h3>1.x</h3>

<h3>0.9.x</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Change the directory and file creation rights to 0700 (thanks to Thomas
    Lußnig for the notice)</li>
  <li>New Bulgarian <code>bg_BG</code> translation (thanks to Marko
  Nikolov)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: URL parsing breaks when an URL contains a semicolon (thanks to
    Shimodax)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v1.0-beta6">1.0-beta6 on 09/23/2006</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Makes possible to use <code>frozen_nick</code> with a empty nick
    parameter. So it's possible to choose the nick at beginning of the
    session then it's impossible to change it.</li>
  <li>Make possible to change dynamicaly the user nickname using the
    parameter array (however, <code>frozen_nick</code> must be on)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the <code>width</code> parameters was broken</li>
  <li>New <code>checktimeout</code> proxy used to disconnect timeouted users
    before playing a command</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the nickname TAB completion was broken.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the % charactere was not allowed in the url format.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the proxy allowed path check was broken.</li>
  <li>Add a new <code>/version</code> command used to get the current
    phpfreechat version.</li>
  <li>New <code>/help</code> command use to list available commands (in
    future, it's planned to display command syntax/description)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: two users with same nick at same time (thanks to wjwlsn, SF
    bug <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1555160&amp;group_id=158880&amp;atid=809601">1555160</a>)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: on some servers (free.fr) the <code>realpath()</code> php
    function is not returning FALSE when the file is missing.</li>
  <li>New feature: when a new message is posted, the unactive window title is
    prefixed by the number of new messages (this can be disabled by setting
    to false the <code>notify_window</code> parameter).</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the <code>max_text_len</code> parameter didn't work with utf8
    (non us-ascii) strings.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: add a references counter in order to know when the user is
    really disconnecter (no more '<code>* quit (timeout)</code>').</li>
  <li>Remove the <code>rm_r</code> and <code>copy_r</code> verification
    because since refactoring I do not copy full directories anymore.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: no more blank screen on IE6!</li>
  <li>Make <code>frozen_channels</code> a dynamic parameter. So it's a way to
    allow/forbid channels depending on external users rights.</li>
  <li>Proxies refactoring : I removed the '<code>proxy</code>' parameter. I
    added '<code>skip_proxys</code>' used to disable a system proxy (ex:
    <code>censor</code>). I added '<code>post_proxys</code>' used to append
    your own proxy to the proxy chaine. I added '<code>pre_proxys</code>'
    used to prepend your own proxy to the proxy chaine. I added
    '<code>proxys_path</code>' used to define the location of your customized
    proxies. I also created demo48 to illustrate this powerfull proxy
  feature.</li>
  <li>Now the commands name are case unsensitive.</li>
  <li>Big containers refactoring: this make possible to handle easily user's
    metadata, fix a bug related to undisconnected but timeouted users and fix
    some memory leak in the default file container.</li>
  <li>Portuguese translation (<code>pt_PT</code>) update (thanks to David
    Pinheiro)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the proxy.php loading was very long with gzhandler enabled
    (thanks to <a href="http://www.freakboard.de">Alexander Blach and Andreas
    May</a>)</li>
  <li>New parameters: '<code>max_channels</code>' used to limit the number of
    channels tabs, '<code>max_privmsg</code>' used to limit the number of
    private messages tabs (sponsored by Johnny Philavanh : $30 USD) [1h].</li>
  <li>Rename bad spelled parameters name : '<code>skip_proxys</code>' to
    '<code>skip_proxies</code>', '<code>post_proxys</code>' to
    '<code>post_proxies</code>', '<code>pre_proxys</code>' to
    '<code>pre_proxies</code>', '<code>proxys_cfg</code>' to
    '<code>proxies_cfg</code>', '<code>proxys_path</code>' to
    '<code>proxies_path</code>', and '<code>proxys_path_default</code>' to
    '<code>proxies_path_default</code>'.</li>
  <li>CPU Optimization: since the new data model some operation were useless
    and CPU consuming.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the <code>/leave</code> command was broken</li>
  <li>Improve <code>noflood</code> proxy algorithme: now it takes into
    account the number of posted characteres and the number of posted
    messages.</li>
  <li>Add a 'Send' button right to the messages input box (sponsored by
    Johnny Philavanh : $25 USD) [2h].</li>
  <li>Disk space optimization: when the last user quit a channel or a private
    room, the messages history is purged in the container. [1h15]</li>
  <li>Bug fix: when a user was disconnected by timeout because of his bad
    connection, when hi comes back he was not correctly reconnected. So,
    private messages were broken. [1h15]</li>
  <li>BBCode colors are now more flexible : I just added a transparent image
    with variable background colors. [45min]</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v1.0-beta5">1.0-beta5 on 09/04/2006</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Big refactoring:
    <ul>
      <li>Set the <code>prefix</code> parameter value to <code>"pfc_"</code>.
        Now this parameter can't be changed because it simplify the new
        developments.</li>
      <li>Change the manner how resources are manager. Resources were copied
        into a public directory. Now resources are just delivered by the
        <code>proxy.php</code> file which is placed into the publix
      directory.</li>
      <li>Remove php code into each resources files (javascript, css). So now
        the chat page size is lighter from -50% (80ko to 30ko).</li>
      <li>No more <code>chat-post.js.tpl.php</code>,
        <code>chat-pre.js.tpl.php</code>, and
        <code>pfcclient-custo.js.tpl.php</code>. All these redundant files
        are now merged into one unique file : <code>customize.js</code>.</li>
      <li>The chat is now generated by Javascript routines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Redesign the default skin (it's nicer for me, maybe for you too ?).</li>
  <li>Remove the <code>contrib</code> directory from the ziped archive when a
    release is done in order to generate smalled archives.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: When <code>/rehash</code> command was run, sometime a js alert
    showing php errors poped up.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the <code>/ban</code> command was broken (see, <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1532838&amp;group_id=158880&amp;atid=809601">sourceforge
    bug1532838</a>)</li>
  <li>Russian translation update (thanks to Kamashev Maim)</li>
  <li>Japanese translation update (thanks to elf2000)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: URL parsing breaks when an URL contains a semicolon (thanks to
    Shimodax)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the proxy parameters should not be passed with a &amp; because
    in php pass-by-reference is setup in the methode prototype. (thanks to
    John Mario Cano)</li>
  <li>New Polish <code>pl_PL</code> translation (thanks to Pawel and
  Jusuff)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the phpfreechat logo was hidden on IE6</li>
  <li>Add an error message in the static html if no javascript is loaded.
    This error message is just removed by the javascript code if the chat is
    created correctly.</li>
  <li>Try to set <code>quit_on_closedwindow</code> parameter to
    <code>true</code> by default. This could be annoying because on each page
    reload or on each page close a notice will be generated (but can be
    disabled with <code>shownotice</code> parameter).</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the nickname encoding was not correctly converted according to
    the <code>output_encoding</code> parameter (cf demo8).</li>
  <li>Bug fix: don't notify (icon blink) the tabs when old message are posted
    (when history is shown at first load)</li>
  <li>Add a popup dialog to ask some text for the bbcode buttons (thanks to
    <a
    href="http://www.phpfreechat.net/forum/viewtopic.php?id=532">Mephisto</a>).</li>
  <li>Add a basic log proxy which store all chat messages into a simple file
    (chat.log)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: fix an infinit loop on windows platform when calculating
    relative path.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: nicknames colors list were not correctly reloaded when al lwas
    assigned.</li>

    bbcode text colors: <code>nickname_colorlist</code> and
    <code>bbcode_colorlist</code>.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: in the default file container, the old messages were never
    deleted. (thanks to dan_m2k, thehermit and AkS for the bug report)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: each commands which displayed an info message
    (<code>/identify</code>, <code>/rehash</code> ...) just cleared the
    screen on IE6. I found a workaround by moving the info message into the
    red error box.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: on IE6 when chinese characteres were typed, the screen goes
    blank. The workeround is to force use of serif (or monospace) font family
    for the chat area (sans-serif will not work).</li>
  <li>Code cleaning: remove the unused csstidy library.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: if <code>preg_*</code> module is not compiled with utf8
    support, a warning occurs.</li>
  <li>Now the online documentation is automaticaly packaged by the release
    script (no more documentation misses).</li>
  <li>Now display the errors when messages can't be written in the default
    file container.</li>
  <li>Replace <code>utf8_substr</code> code by a less system dependant one
    coming from typo3 code.</li>
  <li>Check all parameters types at init step.</li>
</ul>

    were not correctly included in some cases)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: IE doesn't support <code>white-space:pre</code> CSS rule, a
    workaround is to use <code>&lt;nobr&gt;</code> element. This is not XHTML
    complient but it's just a workeround for this crappy IE... (thanks to

</ul>

<h3 id="v0.9.2">0.9.2 on 04/17/2006</h3>

  <li>Bug fix: Links auto-detections didn't work</li>

    the phpfreechat logo link.</li>

    <code>refresh_delay</code> is automaticaly adjusted (multiplied by 2 when
    it fails).</li>

    message length, the color code is shown in chat not the actual chosen
    text color it self.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: There is no line break in chat. If you send long messages they
    just continue in one row, and a horizontal scroll list appears. (this

  <li>Bug fix: remove the annoying "HTTP status 12002" popup dialog</li>

    Please refere to this topic for a workeround <a

  <li>Bug fix: setting showsmileys parameter to false and btn_sh_smileys to
    false didn't work (thanks to Yusuke for the bug report).</li>
  <li>Improve HTTP URL parsing : now long urls are splited with '...'
    (doesn't work on IE6)</li>
  <li>Now <code>shownotice</code> uses a flag system : 0 = show nothing, 1 =
    shows nicknames change, 2 = shows connect/disconnect, 3 = (2+1) shows
    nicknames change and connect/disconnect</li>
  <li>New <code>focus_on_connect</code> parameter: Setting this to true will
    give the focus to the input text box when connecting to the chat. It can
    be usefull not touch the focus when integrating the chat into an existing
    website because when the focus is changed, the viewport follows the focus
    location.</li>
  <li>New <code>quit_on_closedwindow</code> parameter: Setting this to true
    will send a <code>/quit</code> command when the user close his window.
    It's not set to true by default because on IE and Konqueror/Safari, when
    the user reload his page this event occurs.</li>
  <li>New bosnian <code>ba_BA</code> translation (many thanks to Emin
    Jasarevic)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0.9">0.9 on 03/24/2006</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Handle correctly (on FF, IE, Konqueror) the TAB key and use it for
    basic nicknames completion like on IRC.</li>
  <li>Make possible to change the written text color permanently. (internaly
    it uses the bbcode colors)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: On IE6 when showing/hiding the nickname list and the smileys
    list, these boxes disappeared curiously. The workeround is to load an
    image with a very long (&gt;4550 characteres) src url. Why ? I don't know
    !</li>
  <li>Bug fix: When the chat window was leaved open, Internet Explorer could
    crash. This was caused by a memory leak in the xajax v0.2 library. The
    xajax upgrade fix the problem.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Nickname are case sensitive, so in the same chat there can be
    both a "BOB" and a "bob". This is a bug. it should be doing a
    case-insensitive compare so that BOB and bob register as the same
    username.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: nicknames didn't render correctly in Firefox (nowrap CSS rule
    don't work as expected), I noticed the "white-space: pre" rulez works on
    IE and FF. (thanks to JoeHaley for the report)</li>
  <li>Bug fix : email tag won't work if email address starts with letter s
    when use the email syntax [email]email address[/email], if type in an
    email address starting with letter 's', it will print out
  incorrectly.</li>
  <li>New ukrainian translation <code>ua_UA</code> (thanks to <a

    Bondehagen)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0.8">0.8 on 03/03/2006</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add themes support : a theme is a directory containing all the
    necessary ressources (smileys, templates, images) to completly customize
    the chat appearance. When a new theme is created, only the wanted
    ressources can be changed, the default theme is allways the fallback, it
    means a empty theme will work because the default theme will be the
    fallback for the all the ressources.</li>
  <li>Now a command is a class in a file. So, it's very easy to define your
    own commands (see the demo27 for a quick example).</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Using a none default value for <code>prefix</code> makes
    problems with session.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: The <code>clock</code> variable doesn't work as expected.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: it was impossible to create multiple rooms using url
    parameters because <code>server_script_url</code> and
    <code>client_script_url</code> didn't take into account the url query
    string.</li>
  <li>Rename all the i18n directories to match the unix locales standards :
    fr_FR, en_US, ja_JP, ar_LB ... Don't forget to update your config file
  !</li>

    fredcosta)</li>

  lowercase.</li>
  <li>Add a demo to explain how to use <code>server_script_url</code>,
    <code>client_script_url</code> and <code>smileyurl</code> parameters,
    very useful for strange server configurations.</li>
  <li>New serbian / croatian <code>sr_CS</code> translation (many thanks to
    Smilie)</li>
  <li>Add a <code>timeout</code> parameter to the $params array uses to tune
    the time of inactivity to wait before to considere to disconnecte

    Novianto)</li>
  <li>New swedish <code>sv_SE</code> translation (many thanks to Pär

    <code>true</code> will open the followed link in a new window.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Changing nickname to <code>alt</code>, <code>img</code> or
    anything contained into the smiley html image code will make problems
    because the nickname colorization parse also the html smiley code.</li>
  <li>Move smileys, link and nickname highlight parsing to client side (done
    with JavaScript RegExp)</li>
  <li>Integrate bbcode syntaxe. Use <code>[b]text[/b]</code> to bold the
    text, use <code>[i]text[/i]</code> for italic, use
    <code>[u]text[/u]</code> for underline, use <code>[s]text[/s]</code> for
    line-through, use <code>[email]myemail@mydomain.com[/email]</code> or
    <code>[email=myemail@mydomain.com]text[/email]</code> for emails, and
    <code>[color=mycolor]text[/color]</code> for colorize your text (thanks

  <li>Add "phoenity" smiley theme. These smileys have been developed by Lim
    Chee Aun and ported to PHPFreeChat by Robin Monks.</li>

    (thanks to Wendy Novianto for the contribution).</li>
  <li>phpFreeChat now uses a simple php based template engine in order to
    handle easily i18n translations. This modification removes Smarty library
    dependency.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Clicking on the message list area will set focus to input box
    only if the mouse didn't move after the mousedown event (stay
  static).</li>
  <li>Use <a href="http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/index.php/">CSSTidy</a> to
    optimise and to parse the CSS code. (thanks to <a
    href="http://www.nemako.net/">Nemako</a> for this contribution)</li>

<h3 id="v0.6">v0.6 on 02/07/2006</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New minimize/maximize button. Then you can easily integrate your chat
    to weblogs or forums !</li>
  <li><code>connect_at_startup</code> option added. Turning off this option
    will not connect user at startup, to connect he shall click on the login
    button.</li>
  <li><code>nickmarker</code> option added. Turning off this option disable
    nickname colorization.</li>
  <li><code>clock</code> option added. Turning off this option will disable
    date/hour display.</li>
  <li>Reorder smileys and add tux and gnu smileys (Thanks to <a
    href="http://www.yanncochard.com/">Kaella</a> for the nice tux and gnu
    smileys!)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: When the <code>rootpath</code> was empty, it was not set to
    '.'. The xajax relative path (and other depending on this path) was
    broken! (Thanks to <a href="http://www.yanncochard.com/">Kaella</a> for
    reporting this bug)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: When setting same config parameters in two scripts, it makes
    problems because the two script share the same cache id.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: The <code>active</code> option should not be used to
    initialize the auto-connect state because when a user quit, the
    <code>active</code> option is set to false and is stored in session.
    Then, when the user come back, he wasn' auto-connected as it should. This
    option is replaced by <code>connect_at_startup</code>.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: The nicknames colors are limited to 15. So when a 16th user
    connect, his nickname is not colorized. Moreover, the disconnected users
    listed in the message history was colorized.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: On servers where php is executed as cgi, the SCRIPT_FILENAME
    variable doesn't point on the script filename but on thhhe php.cgi file.
    It made problems to calculate relative paths in phpfreechat. Now the
    PATH_TRANSLATED variable is used for cgi configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v0.5">v0.5 on 02/04/2006</h3>

  <li>Refactoring of internal libraries install process (xajax, ie7,
    javascript-libs).</li>

    disconnected as long as next user connect, so it was not possible to
    connect again and take the same nick.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>New feature: Add a nice connect/disconnect icon used to manualy connect

  <li>Bug fix: Nicknames with special caracteres (ex: &lt; &gt;) are not
    displayed correctly in the nickname list and in the notice messages.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: <code>shownotice</code> option didn't work (set it to 0 to
    remove every notice, set it to 1 to show only nicknames changes, set it
    to 2 to show 1+ connect/disconnect notice)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: At first connexion, messages history was shown twice.</li>
  <li>Replace png smileys by gif smileys to avoid black background on th
    crappy IE.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Blocking warning could happen when <code>E_ALL</code> was set
    in php parameters, it made the chat unworkable!</li>

</ul>

    makes possible to open 2 windows on the same chat without any conflicts
    or strange behaviours.</li>
  <li>Add english and french README and INSTALL files.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Smileys was not displayed in <code>/notice</code> and
    <code>/me</code> commands.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: Nicknames were not filtered everywhere so nicknames could be
    too long or with only spaces.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: On IE, first time the chat was displayed, the nicknames list
    was hidden.</li>
  <li>Bug fix: the internal chat identifier was badly calculated and threw
    randomly strange errors.</li>
</ul>

    report)</li>
  <li>Bug fix: I forgot to insert HTML encoding into demo pages.</li>
