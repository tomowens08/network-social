<h2>A free, simple, fast and customizable chat server</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Simple</dt>
    <dd>You only have to <a href="../../install.en.html">copy/paste 3 lines
      of code</a> to have a nice working chat.
      <p>It doesn't require MySQL or any SQL database, messages and nicknames
      are simply stored in files.</p>
    </dd>
    <dd>No problems with firewalls, this script is based on HTTP so you only
      need a web browser and an internet connection. (everyone can easily
      chat!)</dd>
    <dd><p>No problems with none-latin characteres ! Are you Russian,
      Japanese, Turk, Chinese, or Arabic? Whatever language you speak,
      phpfreechat will nicely display your characters because it uses XML
      with UTF-8 to encode characters.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt>Fast</dt>
    <dd>AJAX technology is used to smoothly refresh (no flicker) and display
      the chat and nickname zone.</dd>
    <dd>Messages and nicknames are stored into a simple filesystem, so that
      server resources are saved as much as possible.</dd>
    <dd>Bandwidth is preserved because the server never transmits the same
      data twice, only new messages are transmitted.</dd>
  <dt>Customizable</dt>
    <dd>You can write your own customized CSS stylesheets, to completely <a
      href="../../customize.en.html#cust-theme">change the appearance</a> of
      your chat.</dd>
    <dd>All chat functionalities are customizable. For example, you can
      change the messages refresh time, you can ban users for changing their
      usernames, etc.</dd>
    <dd>The <a href="../../customize.en.html#container-plug">plugin
      system</a> allows you to write your own storage routines. For example,
      you can write a plugin to store the conversations into your
    database.</dd>
  <dt>Opensource</dt>
    <dd>phpFreeChat is an opensource (LGPL) program, so that you can freely
      use it and modify it.</dd>
    <dd><p>I just ask, by gratitude, to keep the linkback logo <img alt=""
      src="../../images/logo_80x15.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" />
       on the pages of your chat.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>All phpFreeChat commands are inspired by the <a
href="http://www.irc.org">irc</a> protocol, and its interface is inspired by
<a href="http://www.mirc.com/">mIRC</a> and <a
href="http://www.xchat.org/">XChat</a>, so that users won't be
disoriented.</p>

<p>Techonologies used by phpFreeChat are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>Â : on the server side :
    conversations are simply stored in filesystems.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.xajaxproject.org/">XAJAX</a> : for the asynchronous
    communication between the client and the server</li>
</ul>
